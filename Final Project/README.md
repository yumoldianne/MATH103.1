# MindInsight Classifier: Unveiling Mental Health Patterns in Pandemic Discourse through Data-Driven Analysis

The chosen dataset was extracted from Kaggle and is titled “Mental Disorders Identification (Reddit)”. It contains 700,000 rows of text data obtained from six (6) subreddits, namely BPD, Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar, Schizophrenia, and Mental Illness. The data was collected using the Reddit API and PushShift API by Kamarul Adha last 2022. The dataset can be accessed online [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamaruladha/mental-disorders-identification-reddit-nlp). 

The objective of this project is to classify Reddit posts into three categories: anxiety, schizophrenia, and others. Two deep learning models, CNN and LSTM, were employed and evaluated based on their training and testing accuracies, as well as precision, recall, and F1 scores.
